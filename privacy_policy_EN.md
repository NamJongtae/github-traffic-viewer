# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [2024-12-11]

This Privacy Policy explains how [Github Traffic Viewer] ("we," "our," or "the extension") collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you use the extension.


## 1. Information We Collect

The extension requires the following information to function as intended:

- **GitHub Username:** Used to identify the GitHub account for accessing repository traffic data.
- **Access Token:** Used to authenticate requests to the GitHub API. This token is only used locally within your browser and is not transmitted to external servers.
- **Repository Name:** Used to specify the GitHub repository for retrieving traffic data.


## 2. Data Storage

The extension stores **GitHub repository traffic data** on your device. This data includes:

- Traffic metrics such as views, unique visitors, and referrer information.

### Storage Details:
- The data is stored using your **browser's local storage, which is part of your device's storage system.**
- **No personal information (e.g., GitHub Username or Access Token) is stored.** These are only used temporarily for API requests and are not retained.

## 3. How We Use the Information

The information collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:

- Fetching traffic data from the GitHub API.
- Displaying the retrieved traffic data within the extension interface for your convenience.

We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third-party services or external servers.


## 4. Security

We take the security of your data seriously. The following measures are in place to protect your information:

1. **Local Data Storage:** Only traffic data fetched from the GitHub API is stored in your device's local storage.
   
2. **Access Token Handling:** Your GitHub Access Token is used only during API requests within the session and is not stored.

3. **Data Isolation:** The extension operates entirely within your browser, ensuring that no data is transmitted to or stored on external servers.

4. **User Responsibility:** Users are encouraged to:
   - Secure their Access Tokens and generate tokens with minimal required permissions.
   - Revoke tokens immediately if they suspect unauthorized use.


## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the extension or on our website. Continued use of the extension after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
