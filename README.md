# github-traffic-viewer

## Introduction

A Chrome extension that leverages the GitHub API to fetch and display traffic statistics for repositories, focusing on providing users with valuable insights into **views** and **unique visitors**.

Since GitHub's traffic data is **only retained for 2 weeks**, this extension **prevents data loss by securely storing historical statistics**. This allows users to analyze long-term trends and gain deeper insights into their repository's performance.

## Features

- Retrieve GitHub traffic data to display **views and uniquevisitors**.
- Data can be displayed in **table or chart** format.
- The retrieved data can be filtered by **date format** and sorted by **oldest, newest, views, or unique visitors**.
- Provide options to download the retrieved data in **JSON, EXCEL, and TXT** formats.
- Fetched data is stored to **prevent data loss**.
- You can save data for **up to 10 repositories**.
- Stored data will be kept for **up to 2 years** and then automatically deleted.

## Important Notes

**üö® Uninstalling this extension will delete all stored data!**
